### Workout-App

During my Web Development bootcamp at neueFische in August and September 2024, I collaborated with three fellow participants (GitHub nicknames: anapecic, Serco627, and LorenzCoachK) to create a workout app using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Next.js. This project, completed within four weeks, allows users to view, create, and manage personalized workouts. The app includes a comprehensive exercise library, enabling users to explore various workouts, warm-ups, and cool-down routines tailored to their fitness goals. Additionally, it features a simple chat function with database integration, allowing users to connect and share tips or motivation. This experience enhanced my skills in front-end and back-end development, fostering a deeper understanding of web applications.
